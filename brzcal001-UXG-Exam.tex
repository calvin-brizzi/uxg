\begin{abstract}

We present the results from an experiment (n=10) which uses a standard measure of flow to investigate the effect of pop-up tutorials on player experience.\\
The results, while not statistically significant, suggest that pop-up tutorials may have a positive effect on flow but require further studies.

\section{Introduction}
One of the principal components of flow is that of action-awareness merging \cite{jackson} and we expect that any interruption to the action (such as the game stopping to give the player instructions) will ‘snap’ the player out of this state and require a certain amount of uninterrupted play to re-enter it.
On the other hand, optimal flow state is achieved when the challenge meets but does not exceed the player’s current skill \cite{nakamura} and we would expect this specific game, due to it’s non-standard control system, to benefit greatly from a tutorial \cite{andersen} accelerating skill acquisition. 
We want to investigate how these two competing effects (the interruptions breaking the action, but increasing the skill level of the player) ultimately influence flow through the use of a standard questionnaire [[CITE]].

Little research has been done on the effects of tutorials on player performance, as the focus seems to revolve more around measuring time spent playing and return rate of players \cite{andersen} or the experiments are conducted on small test groups \cite{hill} that show promising results but no statistical significance. By collecting information on the speed at which players complete post-tutorial levels, we hope to investigate the effect of the interrupting tutorial on the speed at which the player’s learn the game.


\section{Experiment}

We conducted this experiment as part of the User Experience in Games module of the Computer Science Honours Degree at University of Cape Town. A direct comparison of flow scores collected from two separate groups of users each playing a slightly different version of the same game was made: one group acted as a control and played a version where the tutorial prompts were part of the game's background, incorporated into the level, the other group played a version of the game where at specific intervals a pop-up screen would interrupt the game with instructions for the player.\\
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the effect the pop-up tutorial would have on flow as measured by the Short Flow State Scale by Jackson [TO DO REFERENCE!!] which was selected due to it being the closest to a standard for flow measurement.

\subsection{Participants}

We recruited 10 unpaid volunteers who were mostly second and third year computer science students. We did not collect demographic information. Participants were initially randomly assigned to one of the two conditions until the final participants who were assigned to maintain an even number of players for each version.\\
Before beginning they each confirmed that they'd never played the game before (as a version is freely available online).

\subsection{Game}

The game used was Squishy Block, a simple 2D platformer. The game was modified to have two versions: a background tutorial version and a pop-up tutorial version.
In the background version, information on how to play was displayed on small signs that were incorporated into the level. In the pop-up version, information on how to play was displayed in full-screen pop-ups that needed to be manually dismissed by the player before the game could be resumed.

It is important to note that the game was identical in every other way, the text displayed in the pop-up and background prompts was the same and the pop-up prompts triggered at the same point that the background signs were visible to the player to ensure any differences in experience were caused by the format of the tutorial and not the contents. The different versions also had identical soundtrack and sound effects.

The game consisted of two levels; the first contained the tutorial which intruduced the player to the controls and concepts of the game gradually, just before those controls or concepts were necessary (explaining how to deal with enemies just before the first enemy was encountered for example), the second level had no tutorial elements and was designed in such a way to test the player on everything introduced in the first level.

\subsection{Procedure}
The experiment was conducted in three phases: an initial brief questionnaire, the game itself and then a final questionnaire.\\
In the initial phase subjects were briefed on how the experiment would be conducted and asked to rate their previous experience with platformers. Then they switched over to the game, played through the two levels (or until their character died three times) and finally switched back to the final questionnaire, which was the Short Flow State Scale by Jackson.\\
The players were given no instructions on how to play the game before beginning (as this was left up to the tutorial).

\section{Results}

Descriptive statistics for the samples are shown in table \ref{SFSS descriptive}. The data collected was analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired t-test to test for differences in the means of the flow score between the two versions of the game. The results, due probably to the small sample size, were statistically insignificant and are presented in table \ref{ttest}.

    \hline
    background & 3.62 & 0.45 & 5 \\
	pop-up & 4.02 & 0.51 & 5 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion}
The results, while statistically insignificant, seem to imply the counterintuitive conclusion that pop-up tutorials, even though they interrupt the game initially, create an increase in scores in an established flow questinnaire.

The differences in the mean are small and may, in part be explained by the fact that the pop-up version of the game had, on average, participants which rated their previous experience with platformers higher than the control group. 

\section{Conclusion}
The results presented in the paper could be a good starting point for a larger experiment where factors such as previous experience can be better controlled for.

There are various criticisms that can be directed to this experiment. Firstly, and most glaringly, the experiment size is simply too small to be able to reach statistically significant conclusions. The second issue with the experiment is that the game selected, while simple in concept, can be frustrating hard for low-experience players and subsequent experiments might want to select only subjects who are already comfortable with platformers. Finally senior Computer Science students may not be representative of the gaming population so alternative recruitment strategies might be necessary.

This experiment also focused exclusively on the effects the pop-up tutorial would have on flow, but an analysis of their effects on presence might also be useful.

The results of any further studies would allow game creators to design tutorials in a way that aids flow in the game, creating an overall better experience for players.
